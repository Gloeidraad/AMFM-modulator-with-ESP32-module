This section contains designs for a front and back panel for the AM/FM modulator. You find them in the PlayerBack_1_7 and PlayerFront_1_7 directories. You can order the panels at a PCB supplyer or any other panel manufacturer. I recommend a panel thickness of 1 or 1.2 mm. Note that the front panel has also some electronics desing at the back side. This is not used the for player, and can be left wihtout electronic parts.

The main desing (PLL_AM_OSC_1_7_ASSY) is not intended for fabrication, but serves only as a model to show the complete design (case, PCBA, and panels).

Please unzip PLL_AM_OSC_1_7.zip in folder 3D before opening PLL_AM_OSC_1_7_ASSY.kicad_pro
