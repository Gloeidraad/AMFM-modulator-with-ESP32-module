Here you find some STEP files for 3D printing your own housing for the ESP32 Player. 
There are two options:

1 - Just print "Case Body-100mm.STEP" for a simple housing.
2 - "Print Case Body-96mm.STEP", two times "Case Bezel Outer Half.STEP", and two times "Case Bezel Inner Half.STEP"

Option 2 gives you a nicer finish, but need more work. In addition you can customize your housing by using different colors
for the body and the bezels. There are some images included to give you an impression.

Both versions still need front and back panels.
