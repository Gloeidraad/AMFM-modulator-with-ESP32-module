This is an MP3 player, Webradio player, Bluetooth player, and simple waveform generator, based on an ESP32 module. 
The output is connected to a simple FM/AM modulator. The player is intended for collectors and enthousiats of old
(tube) radios. 

The design has been made with KiCad 7.0. I also added some of the specific 3D models.

Software will follow later...

Note: In many countries it is not allowed to build radio transmitters. Altough this design has a range of only a 
few meters, building it is at your own risk.
