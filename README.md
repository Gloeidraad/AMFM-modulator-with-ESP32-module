This is an MP3 player, Web-radio player, Bluetooth player, and simple waveform generator, based on an ESP32 module. 
The output is connected to a simple FM/AM modulator. The player is intended for collectors and enthusiasts of old
(tube) radios.

The original design (V1.5) has been made with KiCad 7.0. The updated design (V1.7) has been made with KiCad 8.0.

I also added some of the specific 3D models.

Note: In many countries it is not allowed to build radio transmitters. Although this design has a range of only a 
few meters, building it is at your own risk.
